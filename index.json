In order to follow the guidelines, certain plot feature need to be set such as trendline colors, font, legend styles and more.\nA notebook was created to show the comparison of the previous styles offered in Pyleoclim from matplotlib and the new styles implemented from SciencePlots which cam be found here: https://github.com/ginnybarnes3/Pyleoclim_util_Barnes/blob/Barnes_Ginny_SciencePlots/PyleoSciencePlotsImplemented.ipynb The file is too large to view on GitHub but the notebook can be downloaded and run on jupyter lab to view the comparisons.\nBoxPlot Fluctuation Analysis ","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701740651,"objectID":"3e050718825977bdecb55c075afa314a","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-paleoclimate/approach/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-paleoclimate/approach/","section":"","summary":"Data science methodology used to address the problem, including data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering techniques, machine learning models, and evaluation metrics.","tags":null,"title":"Approach","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction When implementing functionalities, we make use of several timeseries datasets, specifically paleoclimate datasets for testing.\nData Overview and Examples This is an example of a paleoclimate dataset (MD982181.Khider.2014): Data Accessibility We leverage the Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) standard container and its associated utilities as the source of datasets.\nAlso, more datasets could be found in the pyeloclim repo example_data folder.\nData Formats Paleoclimate data could be in multiple formats, LiPD (.lpd) is not an obligatory entry point to Pyleoclim, low-level modules work on NumPy arrays or Pandas dataframes, so most Pyleoclim timeseries analysis functionalities can apply to these more common types as well.\nData Challenges Paleoclimate data, whether from observations or model simulations, offer unique challenges to the analyst, as they usually come in the form of timeseries with missing values and age uncertainties, which trip up off-the-shelf methods.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701212307,"objectID":"be566fdb6f0fa08cfea50d77a89a6b5a","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-paleoclimate/data/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-paleoclimate/data/","section":"","summary":"Data Assessment Document that gives an overview of the data used for the project.","tags":null,"title":"Data Assessment","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Target for the Semester Outlier detection: KNN: This issue aims to explore how KNN works for timeseries data especially on paleoclimate data.
