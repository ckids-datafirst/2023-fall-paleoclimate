        Pyleoclim is an object-oriented Python package for analyzing and visualizing time-series paleoclimate data, which offer unique challenges to the analyst, as they usually come in the form of timeseries with missing values and age uncertainties. 

        This [Fall 2023](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/editions/2023-fall/#dates) [Pyleoclim](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util) worked on a several expansion of functionalities: outlier detection, visualization, and fluctuation analysis. Specifically, our work focuses on the implementation of outlier detection using KNN, SciencePlot styles, boxplot visualization, and Haar fluctuation analysis.
